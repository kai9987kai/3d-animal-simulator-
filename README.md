DIAMOND Hybrid Agent Simulation
Welcome to the DIAMOND Hybrid Agent Simulation repository! This project simulates an advanced environment where agents utilize cutting-edge AI methodologies, including quantum-inspired neural networks, genetic algorithms, and adaptive learning. Built to explore complex decision-making in dynamic landscapes, the simulation offers a blend of classic AI strategies with experimental quantum-inspired components.

Features
Quantum-Inspired Neural Network Layer: Enhances decision-making with a quantum layer in the neural network, introducing unique randomness and complexity. Uses simulated quantum gates (Hadamard and CNOT) to influence agent behavior.

Genetic Algorithm for Agent Evolution: Implements crossover and mutation to iteratively improve agent strategies. Successful traits from high-reward agents are propagated, evolving optimal survival tactics over generations.

Adaptive Resource and Threat Sharing: Agents can dynamically share information on resources and threats within proximity, promoting cooperation and collective intelligence among agents.

Hybrid Q-Learning and Neural Network Approach: Combines Q-learning for short-term rewards with a neural network layer for long-term strategic behavior, allowing agents to adapt to both immediate and future needs.

Dynamic Day/Night and Weather Cycles: The environment simulates realistic day/night cycles and weather conditions, which impact agent speed, resource visibility, and other survival factors.

Environmental Adaptation and Memory Sharing: Agents store and share memory of environmental features, creating an evolving knowledge base that enriches the agents' awareness of the environment over time.
